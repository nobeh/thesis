\section{From actor \emph{modelling} to actor \emph{programming}}
\label{sec:intro:abs}

Object-oriented programming~\cite{booch1982object,meyer1988object} has been of one the dominant paradigms for software engineering in the past three decades.
One object interacts with another object using the notion of a method.
Method invocations are \emph{blocking}; i.e. the caller object waits until it receives the result of the method call from the callee object.
Surprisingly, such model of interaction was \emph{never} the intention of the creator of the paradigm.
Originally, object interactions were meant to be \emph{messaging} among objects and objects behaved as autonomous entities possibly on remote locations on a network; Alan Kay clarified later~\cite{alank1,alank2}. 
On the contrary, almost all the object-oriented languages at hand have followed the blocking and synchronous model of messaging based on a common misunderstanding. 
The original definition of object-oriented is close to another model of computation: actor model.  

One of the fundamental elements of actor model~\cite{actors:agha,agha97} is \emph{asynchronous} message passing.
In this approach, interactions between objects are modelled as \emph{non-blocking} messages.
One object, the sender, communicates a message to the other object, the receiver.
At the receiver side, a message eventually leads to a method invocation (in an object-oriented paradigm) or a functional call (in a functional paradigm).
In actor model, the locality of the objects is transparent from the messages.
A system is composed of objects with communicating messages.

Considerable amount of research have been carried out to mix object-oriented programming languages with actor model. 
Language extensions, libraries, and even new programming languages are the naturual outcomes of such research.
The more mainstream the language, the more research and development are available in the intersection of object orientation and actor model.
For example, \cite{actor_frameworks_jvm:agha} presents a comparative analysis of such research on Java and JVM languages.

With the rise of computation power, a new aspect added to create a triangle: object-oriented, actor model, and \emph{concurrency}.
Concurrency makes it harder to verify programs in terms of correctness of runtime behavior. 
Scheduling of object messages in threads of executions is one of main challenges.
In addition, in the presence of scheduling and thread interleaving, it is important that objects are able to protect their state from concurrent modifications for correctness properties.
In this research, we take advantage of a modelling language that aims to mix the three aspects in addition to the capabilities of formal semantics and verification.

ABS~\cite{johnsen2012abs,hahnlehjlssw11} is a modelling language for concurrent objects and distributed systems.
ABS provides the semantics of actor model~\cite{actors:agha} as a modelling language.
ABS language provides a set of core features including algebraic data types (ADT), functional layer, and concurrency layer.
ABS concurrency layer lays its basis on co-operative scheduling of active objects~\cite{creol:broch:owe}.
ABS semantics is completely expressed in structural operational semantics~\cite{plotkin:sos}.
This allows ABS models to take advantage of various verification methods and static analysis techniques.
% 
Co-operative scheduling in ABS has been additionally extended for real-time scheduling considering priorities and time constraints~\cite{bjork2013:rtabs,johnsen2012modeling}.
Thus, in general, ABS concurrency layer is a perfect fit if it can be integrated with industry-level real-world programming languages.
% With distributed computing as one of the recent de-facto requirements in every business use case, an enormous effort has gone to improve the current mainstream programming languages to fit for the new requirements of distributed and concurrent sett1ings.

Considering the mainstream programming languages
\footnote{\url{http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html}}, Java~\cite{gosling2000java} is one of the most commonly-used.
Additionally, since Java 1.5 and the rise of concurrency API in Java~\cite{jsr166}, a remarkable effort by the community focus on how concurrency and distribution can be improved in Java as in provided by ABS semantics and actor model.
However, not all the development as Java libraries and frameworks form their basis on formal semantics. 
Therefore, this gives rise to issues and challenges in terms of correctness, semantic preservation, and reasoning.

We target to deliver ABS concurrency layer in form of a Java library API.
However, Java language specification (JLS) clearly concludes that Java language is not comptabile and ready to be extended as a functional language with the support of algebraic data types.
This has been the focus of research and development to extend Java to a functional language~\cite{odersky1997pizza,henkel2003discovering,nystrom2003polyglot,bracha1998making}.
Scala language~\cite{odersky2004scala} is a result of the research that is a dynamic, functional, and object-oriented language on JVM.
Although such extensions over Java towards a functional language exist, they lack formal semantics in the context of concurrency and actor model.

We primarily focus on ABS concurrency layer as a Java library API.
We argue that the advantage of a correct semantic translation from ABS concurrency layer to its Java equivalent constructs overcomes the additional support of functional layer but with \emph{partial} formal semantics.
Our approach enables programmers to model their Java systems in terms of ABS concurrency semantics and then create a correct mapping and implementation from ABS to Java using an API.
In addition, we aim to facilitate ways to actually program in ABS models as if the programmer is able to take advantage of standard Java libraries.

In the next section, we sketch a high-level overview of the architecture design goals and how this research plans its objectives.

\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:intro:arch:crit}

\paragraph{Polyglot Programming}
With the rise of distributed computing challenges, software engineering practice has turned to methods that combine multiple programming languages and models to complete a task. 
In this approach, different languages with different focus and abstractions contribute to the same problem statement in different layers. 
Polyglot programming essentially enables software practice to apply the \emph{right} language in the appropriate layer of the problem statement. 
In this research, we follow the question in which we try to deliver ABS semantics and features in a polyglot approach. 
The programmer develops models with ABS that \emph{partically} take advantage of the target language features (e.g. from Java).
This approach is also referred to as \emph{Foreign Function Interface} in the context of ABS modelling.
Listing~\ref{lst:abs:java} shows an ABS code that uses \jtt{java.util.ArrayList} as a data strucuture.
With Polyglot programming in ABS, the programmer does \emph{not} need to define the abstractions necessary for the list construct. 

\begin{lstlisting}[float=h,language=Java,caption=Using Java in ABS,label=lst:abs:java]
List<String> params = new ArrayList<>();
myObj ! doSomething(params);   
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Scalability} 
The distribution level that asynchronous message passing mechinism deliver
challenges performance efficiency.
In such a context, the number of messsages delivered among actors in the 
environment is not predictable at runtime.
The goal is to ensure the actor system scales in performance with least 
influence from the number of asynchronous messages delivered in the system.
We direct benchmarks on the system to present the performance of the system
using different number of messages delivered in the system.

\paragraph{Modularity} 
The scope of the research spans to a number of layers revolving around ABS
 language:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Compiling ABS to a target programming language}
One first objective it compile an ABS model to a target programmig language.
The compilation can be at \emph{source-to-source} or \emph{source-to-bytecode}
level.
Target languages potentially include mainstream programming languages such as
Java, Erlang, Haskell, and Scala.
Thus, the ABS programmer should be able to use an ABS compiler to compile
their ABS models to the target languages.
\item \emph{Using ABS semantics as an API in a programming language}
ABS language is precisely expressed with structural operational semantics~\cite{johnsen2012abs} in addition to its syntax definition.
Therefore, the semantics of ABS can be delivered in a programming language
as Application Programming Interface (API) as long as the programming language provides sufficient constructs to respect ABS language semantics.
In addition, such ABS programming API should be \emph{verifiable}.
If such ABS mapping to a programming API is provided, a programmer is able to
take advantage of ABS semantics without directory programming in ABS.
Such capability from ABS enables industry users of mainstraim languages to
model their systems in ABS semantics using their programming languages and
platforms.
\item \emph{Modelling in ABS}
ABS language provides solid structure and semantics to model concurrent
and distributed systems.
The user (that can be a programmer, an analysist, or a researcher) rightfully
demands to have access to a tool-set and IDE that allows working with ABS 
models in a user-friendly way.
The ABS IDE and tool-set developers should be able to easily reuse and compose
over existing modules and components.
\end{itemize}

Based on the scopes and layers of usage of this research, we aim to provide 
a highly modular architecture in design and implementation.
The goal is verifiable based on produced artifacts of this research in terms
of their \emph{usability}, \emph{re-usability}, and \emph{composability} in
different contexts.

\paragraph{Extensibility}
Delivering ABS language features as an API brings about a new requirement to be able to configure and extende the API. 
It is a common practice in software engineering that components are developed with a mixture of \emph{configuration}, \emph{extension} and \emph{composition}.
Therefore, the ABS programmer should be able to extend such API to custom requirements. 
The extensibility is provided either through configuration of the API or API extension.

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} presents the general architecture of the implementation.

\section{Literature Overview}
\label{sec:intro:rel}

\subsection{Programming Languages Overview}
\label{sec:intro:proglangs}

In this section, we briefly provide an overview of the programming languages that have targetted the similar problem statements.
It is important to note the timeline and the rapid evolution of programming languages trying to provide an actor-based model of asynchronous message passing.
In addition, we identify different types of research and work related to actor model and concurrency programming:
\begin{description}
\item[First-Class Citizen]
is the type of programming languages that deliver actor model programming support as a first-class citizen of the language.
In such languages, actor model is by-design part of the syntax and semantics of the language.
\item[Implicit By Design]
refers to the type that there is no explicit notion of actor models in the language syntax or semantics.
However, the programming language provides fundamental constructs for concurrenty and asynchronous message passing.
Thus, it becomes a trivial task in such type of programming languages to create an abstraction to support the actor model by coding.
\item[External Library]
refers to the type of programming languages for which actor model support is possible through using an external library developed for the language.
\end{description}

\subsection{Frameworks and Libraries}
\label{sec:intro:libs}

In the previous section, we presented an overview of the programming languages and their categories that aim to provide actor model~\cite{agha86book}.
Since many programming languages faced different challenges to provide the necessary syntax and semantics for this at the level of the language, many libraries and frameworks have been born with a motivation to fill this gap.
We observe that the more the language itself is close to the actor model semantics, the less external libraries and frameworks target this gap. 
In the following, we briefly provide a few frameworks
\footnote{A more comprehensive list can be obtained at \cite{KarmaniSA09} and  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model\#Programming_with_Actors}}
and libraries for Java as one of the main focus areas of this research is to study this gap for a mainstream language such as Java.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Actor programming libraries in Java}
\label{tbl:actor:libs}
\end{table}

One of the main techniques used in libraries to deliver actor programming in Java is byte-code engineering~\cite{dahm1999byte,bruneton2002asm,asm}.
Byte-code engineering modifies the generated byte-code for compiled classes in Java either during compilation or at runtime.
Although, this technique is commonly used and argued to provide better performance optimization~\cite{vallee1999soot}, it introduces deep challenges regarding the verification of the running byte-code~\cite{leroy2001java,leroy2003java}.
Thus, one of the main objectives in this research to provide a \emph{statically} verifiable technique to provide actor programming in Java.
