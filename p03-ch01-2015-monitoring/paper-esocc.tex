\section*{Abstract}
\label{abstract}
In this paper, we introduce a  formal model of the  availability, budget compliance
and  sustainability of distributed services, where service   sustainability is
a new concept which arises as 
% an extension of 
the composition of 
service  availability and budget compliance.
The model formalizes a distributed  platform for monitoring the above
service characteristics in terms of a parallel composition of task automata,
where dynamically generated tasks model asynchronous events with deadlines.
The main result of this paper is a formal model to optimize and reason about service characteristics
through monitoring.
In particular, we use schedulability analysis of the
underlying timed automata to optimize and guarantee service sustainability.

%to capture characteristics of a distributed deployment environment.
%In the distributed deployment, a service runs across several resources in a virtualized environment.
%We formalize characteristics of a distributed service by service availability and service budget compliance.
%We introduce service sustainability as an extension and composition of the two.
%We design timed automata to ensure the given service level agreement for each characteristic.
%The formal model is realized by devising an actor-based distributed monitoring platform using the Abstract Behavioral Specification language ABS.
%We discuss how the characteristics of the model can be utilized in the application and business in different aspects.
%In addition, we discuss how monitoring model parameters; e.g. monitoring window; influence maintaining service characteristics in a distributed environment.
% We present algorithms to generate the monitoring platform components given input parameters in order to guarantee the defined service level agreements.
